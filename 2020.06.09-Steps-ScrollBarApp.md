- new project

- empty layout

- android API 4.1 lollipop, which makes it more compatible. it's too simple so it doesn't matter.

- In XML, delete `androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout` and use `FrameLayout` instead.

    - For when you only have one element at a time, more simple than constraintlayout.

- Both constraintlayout and framelayout are used as containers to apply settings to child nodes, TextView in this case.

- remove the attributes that belonged to the constraintlayout element.

- In FrameLayout, layout_width:"match_parent" means FrameLayout element will take the whole width available.

- TextView's layout_width:"wrap_content" means width will be determined by content inside of it, in this case, "hello world".

    - set TextView's layout_width:"match_parent". now it takes the whole width available to FrameLayout.

- Create an Id. It's a way to create a reference to our UI component from Java.

    - Add a declaration within TextView, `android:id=""` 
    - "android" comes from `xmlns:android` (xml namespace)
    - we must let studio know we're not gonna input text. By that, we use "@". it'll show the suggestion `@+id/`. 
    - Enter the value of your id after the slash. `android:id="@+id/text"`

- Go to java class.

- onCreate method shows the user first thing they should see.

- create a variable inside MainActivity class

    - Type "TextView". While typing, select the suggestion "android.widget"
        - this automatically adds the import statement at the bottom, for the TextView object into Java
    - give the variable a name: "textTextView", leave uninitialized

- Within the onCreate method, before the ending brace, initialize variable textTextView

    - use the id of TextView to find the TextView object from xml. use findViewById().
    - Inside the parentheses, say "R". This Java class automatically contains resources and names and Ids you create to your application.
    - "R.id.text" asks for the id resource named "text", which we created in the xml.

- Put text inside the xml TextView object.

    - `textTextView.setText("test");` will set the content for the TextView element.
    - you may run the app to see if "test" is displayed in the layout.

- make a class to store our text data. new class file within folder java/com.example.scrollbarapp, name it "Text"

    - add a public method (accessible anywhere in Java). Static, so this class can access this method directly. Return type string array `String[]`. Name `getText()`. No parameters.
    - inside it, `return new String[]{}` to return a new string array object. 
    - within the curly braces, Add several strings, separated by commas, sentences preferable.

- back in java file, we need to access the text we put in our Text class.

    -  delete `textTextView.setText("test");` from last step. 
    - initialize a new object, type `String[]` , name  `myText`, value `Text.getText()`. now `myText` has the string array with the sentences.

- put the sentences in the TextView

    - do a for loop, where for each text string in myText , you append the text to textTextView and add two lines.

    - ```java
        for (String text : myText){
        	textTextView.append(text + "\n\n");
        }
        ```

- Add padding by adding the declaration `android:padding="16dp"` to xml.

- run app. make sure there's enough text to need a scroll bar. if not, add more text.

- inside the FrameLayout xml element, before TextView, add ScrollView

    - set width to match parent, so it's as large as the FrameLayout, and set height to wrap content, so it's as large as the text needs.
    - wrap the TextView within the ScrollView element.

- App is ready.
